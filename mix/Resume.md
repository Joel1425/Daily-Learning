#### Curriculam Vitae (CV)

- `Resume` comes from the French word résumé, meaning “summary.” A resume is a high-level summary of a person’s professional experience, education, certifications, and skills. It serves as a snapshot of a person’s professional experience.
- `CV` comes from the Latin phrase curriculum vitae, meaning “course of life.” A CV is a detailed collection of all of a person’s professional and educational experiences, accomplishments, and awards. It serves as a brief personal and professional biography. In the U.S., CVs are the most common documents in academia.

- Many applicants include a summary statement on their resumes. A summary statement is a few short sentences highlighting why you’re a valuable employee. A summary statement can be a powerful way to capitalize on the short time hiring managers spend on your resume by succinctly presenting your skills and passions. You can think of it as an attention-grabbing blurb, tag line, or hook.

- As you draft your summary statement, `be specific about your desired role`. Start your summary with a specific title like “City Planner,” “Administrative Professional,” or “Fundraising Specialist,” and follow it with no more than three sentences summing up your experience, skills, and goals. These sentences should describe what defines you as a professional in your field. 

- You can also use your summary to highlight your goals and demonstrate how you hope to work toward them in your next role.

For example, if you graduated with a degree in Computer Science and are applying for an IT help desk job, you could highlight that you enjoy using technology to improve others' lives.

#### Contact Information
Be sure to include your full name at the top of your resume. Even if you submit a resume through email, don’t assume 
someone will make a note of your email address. Have your phone number, professional email address, physical address, 
and website (or online portfolio link) front and center. Remember: you want to make it easy for potential employers to 
contact you.

#### Summary Statement
This statement `highlights your skills and experiences`. Typically found before your work experience and education, the summary
sets the stage for your accomplishments and highlights how you would `contribute to a potential employer’s organization`.

#### Work Experience
Think about the various jobs you’ve held. Ideally, you’ll have at least two to put on your resume and can list a `few bullet 
points` about each. For each job, `highlight any actionable, quantifiable responsibilities` you had and the key skills you used 
or developed. Every item you `describe should be in the past tense` except those related to your `current job`. Finally, keep 
your entries relevant to the role you’re applying for. This requires a bit of extra work, but candidates who tailor their 
resumes to specific positions are more successful job-hunters than those who send a generic resume as a part of all their 
applications.

#### Education
This section contains the `most recent educational institution(s)` you’ve attended, years of attendance, degree earned, and 
`relevant coursework`. If you are currently pursuing a degree, you can include that as well. As you begin your career, keep 
this section near the top. After you gain significant professional experience, it should fall `below Work Experience`.

#### Additional Skills
You may have `skills that do not fit neatly into any other section` on your resume. Maybe you are fluent in another language, or 
perhaps you have a relevant set of `awards or certifications`. Depending on the industry, having a separate 'Additional Skills' 
section `towards the bottom` that covers these abilities may prove helpful. For technical positions, this is where you 
should list your knowledge of `specific programming languages` or `software tools`.

#### Interests
Interest sections of resumes describe personal interests. They are an opportunity for hiring managers to relate to you 
on a personal level. You can include `sports`, `books`, `movies`, `cooking`, `traveling`, or any other (appropriate) 
hobby or personal interest. The more specific, the better!

### Formatting

- A well-formatted resume helps the hiring manager's eyes logically and consistently progress down the page.

#### Clear, Readable Font
Your `font choice` should be `professional` and `legible`. Remember, the literal translation of resume is `summary`. Use an `11- or 12`-point 
font; if you use anything smaller, people will be `squinting` to read it. Try `Calibri` or `Arial` as a standard typeface 
for a contemporary look and `Times New Roman` or another `serif` style for a `more traditional approach`.

#### Simple Headings
Each section should be `labeled clearly and professionally`. Although it may be tempting to label your work experience as 
something more creative, the classic `Work Experience` is a good option. If you want to `highlight` a specific type of 
experience like customer service, a label such as `Customer Service Experience` could also work. Just keep in mind that 
`simple headings make your resume more readable.

#### Succinct, Bulleted Task Lists
Breaking up long paragraphs with bullets calls out key points and makes your resume easier to read. `Work Experience` is 
likely to be your most content-heavy section, so you’ll want to use bulleted lists. They may also come in handy in your education 
section if you hold many degrees.

#### Consistent Margins
No matter what software program you choose to write your resume in, `remember to keep the margins consistent`. You want a balanced 
amount of white space, so try to `avoid overly narrow or wide margins`. It is standard practice to `keep resume margins to one inch`.

### Work Experience Bullets
For each job in our bullets, we should have `three` or `four` bullet points that highlights the most `interesting`, impressive, 
and relevant things we did in the position.

#### Focus on relevant responsibilities 
You won’t be able to list all of your job duties. Instead, focus on the `most impressive and relevant ones`. Highlight tasks that 
required a `high skill level` or `specialized knowledge` and any additional responsibilities you took on, such as `training 
other employees` or `managing large amounts of money`.

#### Begin bullet statements with verbs
Use a `variety of verbs` throughout your resume. For current jobs, use the `present tense`; all previous jobs should use the `past tense`.
Make sure these verbs are active. For example, `Processed` is a good way to start a bullet statement. On the other hand, 
`Was responsible for processing` is not active, so we shouldn’t use it. Some powerful verbs include:
     
     - Analyzed
     - Collaborated
     - Conducted
     - Controlled
     - Coordinated
     - Created
     - Designed
     - Developed
     - Established
     - Evaluated
     - Executed
     - Generated
     - Implemented
     - Improved
     - Increased
     - Launched
     - Led
     - Maximized
     - Organized
     - Prepared
     - Quantified
     - Reduced
     - Secured
     - Strengthened

#### Quantify your accomplishments
Each statement should also include numbers and time frames that quantify your impact and abilities. 'Processed cash and credit transactions' 
is not a bad bullet statement, but 'Processed up to $2,000 in cash and credit transactions daily' is much better. 
'Crafted and served up to 200 specialty coffee drinks per shift' is much more impressive than 'Served coffee.' 

#### Start strong
Remember that hiring managers typically read your resume in an `F` pattern, or by scanning down the left side of the page 
and following anything that looks interesting. To catch their eyes, make sure to lead your `bullet statements` with your 
most impressive accomplishments.
 
#### Do not embellish
`Overselling` your experiences may get you a lot of initial attention, but it will not pay off in the long term. If it appears 
you’ve `misrepresented` some or all of your qualifications, suspicious employers will either ignore your resume altogether or 
investigate your claims. Your `credibility and reputation suffer when you misrepresent yourself`.
 
## Best Practices
#### Keep It One page
Mid- and late-career professionals can exceed one page. Everyone else should `keep it brief`. You can keep your resume to one 
page by removing unnecessary language, experimenting with typefaces, and using `active verbs`.

#### Keep It Relevant
Because your `resume is a summary`, you should `emphasize different things` for the various jobs you apply for. Save different 
versions of your resume for easier customizing later on.

#### Keep It Searchable
The first person to read your resume may not be a person at all. Many organizations use `computerized searches to sort` through 
resumes, so make sure to clearly state your `relevant skills` and `experiences`.

#### Keep It Three Formats
Saving your resume as a `PDF` preserves formatting for those who will read it on different devices. Saving it as a `Microsoft Word` 
document ensures that you have it in the most common file format. Saving it as a `plain text` document prevents the clutter of format-specific 
information when uploading to a computerized applicant tracking system. it’s always handy to have different versions saved just in case

#### Keep It Clean
One typo can undermine all of the hard work you’ve put into creating a professional resume. Check your spelling and ask your 
friends and family to review it. This may sound tedious, but you need to make sure it’s perfect before you hand it to a potential employer.

## Why Cover Letter Necessary
- if my resume contains my most important work-related information, why bother writing a cover letter? The answer is simple: taking 
the time to write a thoughtful, personalized cover letter shows that you’ve put more than a few seconds’ thought into applying for a job. 
When done right, cover letters help your application stand out.
- Resumes should be clear and factual but still engaging. Your cover letter, on the other hand, can reveal a little more about 
who you are and why the position interests you. Avoid repeating what is on your resume. Instead, use the cover letter as an 
opportunity to share information that couldn’t fit on your resume. Be explicit about what you’ve done in the past and what you plan 
to do in the future. If the organization’s work or mission is particularly appealing to you, use the cover letter to highlight your passion.
- Cover letters are a vehicle for showcasing your understanding of an organization and how your passions and strengths intersect 
with its goals and needs. Review the organization’s website to get a feel for its language. Mirroring its tone is an effective 
way to show that you’ve done your research and know how to fit in. For example, the cover letter you write for an offbeat startup 
would be different than one you would write for a traditional consulting firm or a faith-based nonprofit. Your cover letter 
is important because it serves as professional proof that you are actually interested in the organization and that you 
can properly engage with it.
- Finally, some employers ask for a cover letter simply to see which applicants read—and follow!—directions. They may ask you to 
address something specific, such as compensation, in your cover letter and immediately dismiss any applicants who ignore this request.  

## Cover Letter Format and Content
- Make sure `your name and current contact information` appear at the `top`, along with the `date`. Address your letter to the 
person who will receive your application. If the `hiring manager’s name isn’t included` in the job description, `do some research`: 
the company website, social media profiles, and simple Internet searches are all good places to begin. If, after a lot of 
searching, you still aren’t able to find the name of the hiring manager or make an educated guess, address your letter using 
the traditional `To Whom It May Concern,` the contemporary `Dear Hiring Manager,` or the title of the hiring manager or committee.

- Like resumes, cover letters `vary in structure`. Once you are in the right mindset, follow this standard guide for the bulk of your letter’s content:

## Cover Letter Best Practices

#### Avoid Filler
Imagine that anyone who reads your cover letter already values what you have to offer. Try not to think of your letter as a 
direct sales pitch. Approach your letter with `honesty and humility`, but don’t `shy` away from `including relevant achievements`.

#### Include Referrals
If someone who works for the `organization referred you to the position`, include that information. Most organizations give 
`special consideration to applicants referred by a current employee`. Current employees understand the culture and demands 
of their workplace; they know if a friend or acquaintance has what it takes to succeed there.

#### Clarify Career Gaps
If your resume shows periods during which you weren’t working (or studying, in the case of full-time students), use your cover 
letter to explain those gaps. If you `moved to a different city`, took time off to care for a sick relative, or were 
otherwise occupied during that time, mention it.

#### Avoid Apologies
You may not have every qualification the employer has listed in the job description. This is okay.  Employers tend to list 
every single thing they `would like their ideal candidates` to have, and they realize that they may `need to compromise` when 
choosing applicants to interview (and eventually hire). You don’t have to justify why you can do the job even though you 
don’t possess all of the necessary qualifications. Apologizing for experience or skills you lack isn’t necessary or 
attractive, and you don’t want to `sound defensive or unconfident`. Instead, write about why you’d be good at the job in a humble way.

#### Be Nice
Something that `holds true in your cover letter` and during your interview is to `never say anything bad about your current or former employer`. 
`No matter how difficult the situation is or was`, you should be as `diplomatic as possible`, `demonstrating an understanding` 
of the challenges your employer faces or once faced. Saying `negative things makes you look angry and unprofessional`, and the 
people you’re interviewing with may wonder what `you will say about them one day`. Keep negative comments out of the job-hunting process.
