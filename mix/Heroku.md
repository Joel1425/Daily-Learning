#### Some reasons we might want to push a new version to `staging` frist instead of going straight to production.
- If our app crashes on launch (or on the first query), we don't want all our users to be inconvenienced.
- The staging environment lets our lawyer check it for copyright violations.
- Staging environments are always faster than production, so we can make changes quicker.
- If we push to production and it breaks, our users will be affected.
- If the new version needs more resources (like CPU or memory) we can find out in staging instead of finding out when we 
  get a giant bill for production resources
