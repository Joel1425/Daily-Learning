#### What is Transport Layer Security (TLS)  
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between  
two communicating applications. It's the most widely deployed security protocol used today, and  
is used for Web browsers and other applications that require data to be securely exchanged over a  
network, such as file transfers, `VPN connections`, `instant messaging` and `voice over IP`.  
TLS evolved from Netscape's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. 

#### What is SSL certificates?
SSL Certificates, sometimes called digital certificates, are used to establish a  
secure encrypted connection between a browser (user's computer) and a server (website).  
The SSL connection protects sensitive data, such as credit card information, exchanged   
during each visit (session). Whether you need to secure one or many domains, one or multiple   
servers, DigiCert offers a full line of SSL Certificate products to meet your needs.
