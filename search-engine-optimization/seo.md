### What is the canonical link element?

The `rel=canonical` element, often called the *“canonical link,”* is an HTML element that helps webmasters **prevent duplicate content issues**. It does so by specifying the “canonical URL,” the “preferred” version of a web page. Most of the time, this is the source URL. *Using canonical URLs improves your site’s SEO*.


The idea is simple. If you have several versions of the same content, you pick one “canonical” version and point the search engines at it. Doing so [solves the duplicate content](https://yoast.com/duplicate-content/) problem where search engines don’t know which version to show in their results.


```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://yoast.com/wordpress-seo/" />
```
